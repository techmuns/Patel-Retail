/**
 * analyze-company.mjs — orchestrator for the concall analysis engine.
 * ===================================================================
 * Ported unchanged from ceekay-munshot/dakshamconcall's screener-test/ (see
 * PATEL-HANDOFF.md §21) — the pipeline logic is genuinely company-agnostic
 * (a TICKER in, a tear sheet out), so nothing here needed to change to point
 * it at Avenue Supermarts / Vishal Mega Mart / Trent / Spencer's Retail
 * instead of the donor's tracked list. Patel Retail itself is privately held
 * and very likely has no Screener.in page at all — see §21 before assuming
 * TICKER=PATEL (or similar) will resolve to anything.
 *
 * Take a TICKER (env TICKER) — or loop over tracked.json when TICKER is empty
 * (refresh mode) — and for each company:
 *   1. mark jobs.json[TICKER] = running and commit EARLY (UI shows Processing),
 *   2. scrape Screener's latest concall summary (transcript fallback),
 *   3. classify it (+ up to 3 prior quarters) into the fixed 11-section schema,
 *      finalizing guidance-vs-delivery statuses deterministically,
 *   4. write the tear sheet into public/data/*.json and commit the result.
 *
 * Per-company errors are captured into jobs.json (friendly "failed" state) —
 * one bad company never crashes the whole run. Commits use a re-apply-on-reject
 * push loop so concurrent runs never clobber each other's JSON.
